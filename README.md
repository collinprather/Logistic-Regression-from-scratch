# Logistic Regression From Scratch
This repository contains my final project in Math Research Methods at Cornerstone University, Spring 2018. You'll find an implementation of logistic regression from scratch in python on the iris dataset.
There were three components to this project:
* [Research paper](https://github.com/collinprather/Logistic-Regression-from-scratch/blob/master/logistic_regression.pdf)
* Presentation
  * [Slides](https://github.com/collinprather/Logistic-Regression-from-scratch/blob/master/lr_beamer.pdf)
  * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz9zeUQQB-I&feature=youtu.be)
* [Code](https://github.com/collinprather/Logistic-Regression-from-scratch/blob/master/Logistic_Regression_Iris.ipynb)
